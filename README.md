HW3: Submitted By Tomer Tzipel & Ori Shaham Bar

Start in the LobbyScene3 to join a lobby and create a session just like in HW1/2.
You can now set a lobby to not be visiable when creating it. (Obviously still joinable by creating a session with the same name).

The master client can now lock the lobby so other players won't be able to join the session.

Players now move using RMB by clicking on the platform (RTS/MOBA like movement)
and they can fire a projectile using Q which will fire it in the direction of the mouse.

Players who are hit by another's projectile will lose health and destroy it.


HW2: Submitted By Tomer Tzipel & Ori Shaham Bar

Start in the LobbyScene2 to join a lobby and create a session just like in HW1.
Creating/joining a session will move you to the game scene where you will choose a name and a color for the chat.
The chat can be opened and closed using ENTER, the chat will close after 5 seconds upon recieveing a message (if you didn't open the chat prior to it).
After confirming you will have to choose your character from the AMAZING selection of heroes.
After the selection you will spawn in that hero spawn point, where you can chat atleast until HW3.



HW1: Submitted By Tomer Tzipel & Ori Shaham Bar

The scene starts with a choice between 5 lobbies which will join the player into the chosen lobby.
Afterwards a panel showcasing the the sessions within said lobby in a list, the number of sessions, a leave lobby button and a create session button.
Clicking create session will open the create session panel which asks for a session name and max number of players.
Creating the session will join the player into said session and show him the session panel where he can see the session name, number of players and the ID of the players.
Attempting to join a full session will keep the player in the lobby he was by rejoining him to the lobby after the shutdown from the failed join.
Please don't click on other buttons while something is ongoing :(, thx.
