HW1: Submitted By Tomer Tzipel & Ori Shaham Bar

The scene starts with a choice between 5 lobbies which will join the player into the chosen lobby.
Afterwards a panel showcasing the the sessions within said lobby in a list, the number of sessions, a leave lobby button and a create session button.
Clicking create session will open the create session panel which asks for a session name and max number of players.
Creating the session will join the player into said session and show him the session panel where he can see the session name, number of players and the ID of the players.
Attempting to join a full session will keep the player in the lobby he was by rejoining him to the lobby after the shutdown from the failed join.
Please don't click on other buttons while something is ongoing :(, thx.
